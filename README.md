# DevelopmentUrlInterceptor
Intercept development URLs and open them in a specific browser

VPN's are great, but they tend to block MDNS making it difficult to access your development server from your mobile phone running a VPN. This app fixes that by intercepting local development URLs and redirecting them to a different browser instead.

How to get started:

- In your VPN settings, exclude a particular browser (your non main browser) from the VPN
- Configure this application to open all local development URLs in that browser
  - Change your local development urls here: 
  - Set the package name of your development browser here:
